In this project, we will build a deep learning model to classify the sentiment of messages from [StockTwits](https://stocktwits.com/), a social network for investors and traders. The model will be able to predict if any particular message is positive or negative. With this, we will be able to generate a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols.
